#  TODO (some day)
#
#  --> The system don't allow the change of the x and y initial positions  (break the digit logic).
#  --> The system don't allow the color change of the segments. (break the digit logic, don't receive the values of the counter and the timer)
#        The digits are fixed at green when segments are on and light gray when segments are off.
#  ---> The system don't allow the change in the size of the digits. (break the digits, only work at 200)
#
#  Don't change any value in the main, just run the program.
