Sometimes even going past 4 am.&#10; &#10; Sadly, with that time i was unable to finish some things in the project.&#10; &#10; TODO (some day)&#10;&#10; --&gt; The system don't allow the change of the x and y initial positions  (break the digit logic).&#10; --&gt; The system don't allow the color change of the segments. (break the digit logic, don't receive the values of the counter and the timer)&#10;       The digits are fixed at green when segments are on and light gray when segments are off.&#10; ---&gt; The system don't allow the change in the size of the digits. (break the digits, only work at 200)&#10; &#10; Don't change any value in the main, just run the program. &#10; &#10;" />
